    "Consider a random variable $x$ described by p.d.f. $f(x)$. The sample space here is all possible values of $x$. $n$ independent observations of $x$, also called sample of size $n$, can be considered as a single measurement with joint p.d.f. $f_{sample} (x_1, x_2, ... x_n) = f(x_1)f(x_2)...f(x_n)$. \n",

The central problem here is to infer properties of $f(x)$ based on observations $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$. Often one already has a hypothesis for p.d.f. $f(x, \\theta)$ with unknown parameter(s) $\\theta$, and the goal is to construct a function for observations $x_i$ to estimate $\\theta$.\n",

The estimator for parameter $\\theta$ is often denoted $\\hat{\\theta}$. If $\\hat{\\theta}$ converges to $\\theta$ in the limit of large sample size $n$, the estimator is said to be consistent. The procedure of estimating the value of a parameter is called parameter fitting. \n",

If entire experiment of $n$ measurements were repeated multiple times, each time with different sample $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$, the estimator $\\hat{\\theta}(x)$ would have different values, distributed based on some p.d.f. $g(\\hat{\\theta}; \\theta)$.
